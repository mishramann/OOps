// In the World of java there is three types of Error
Types of errors:

1. Syntax error // compile nahi hoga
2. Logical error // compile hoga chal bhi jayga kuch or hi expect kar raha h
3. Runtime error // through the time of execution this error comes.

The Exception Handling is a way to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the applicattion can be maintained

Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
