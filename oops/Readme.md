OOps is the way of programming where we deals with object and class.
java is case-sensitive language.
class is a blueprint of object.
class is a collection of objects.
class is a user-defined data type.
java is the platform independent language.
java is a high-level programming language.
Object is an instance of class.
Method - Behaviour
OOps - Object and class
Four principles of OOps

1. Encapsulation -Buundling of data and method into a single unit called class. hide the thing which thing user not want to see anyone.
2. Inheritance - child class inherit the property of parent class.
3. Polymorphism - make a various class implement through parents and acces them with object by reference to the parent class
4. Abstraction - hiding implementation details
   Out of these 52 keywords:
   50 keywords: are actively used in Java programming.
   2 keywords(const and goto):are reserved but not actively used in modern Java programming.They exist to prevent future conflicts or misuse.
   It is important to note that keywords cannot be used as identifiers(like variable or class names) because they are reserved for specific functions within the language.
   All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
   These unique names are called identifiers.

   Method - Syntax
   accessmodifier returntype methodName (parameter){
   //method-body
   }

   tokens -
   Method Overriding - it is also a principle of polymorphism if the child class implement the same method again
   Method overLoading - it is the principle of polymorphism a class with the multiple method with different parameter method name and return type are same but parameter different
   Method Signature - methodName(argumentlist)
   m1(int num , String s);

Mutable -:
Mutable class objects are those whose state can be modified after initialization. This means the values of their fields can be changed, add or remove elements from the collections they contain, ie generally alter their internal state. Examples of mutable objects are Java's StringBuilder, StringBuffer, & java.util.Date.
Multiple Inheritence not work in java
Method Overloading - Compile Time
Metho Overriding - Runtime -> its also called Dynamic method dispatch
